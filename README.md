This is a Windows notification area (systray) app that shows who is currently online on [Wurstmineberg](https://wurstmineberg.de/).

For an equivalent macOS app, see [bitbar-server-status](https://github.com/wurstmineberg/bitbar-server-status).

# Installation

1. Download the file `Wurstmineberg.exe` from [the latest release](https://github.com/wurstmineberg/systray/releases/latest).
2. Now you can simply double-click the file to run it. Nothing will happen if no one is online, but the icon will appear once there's someone in the main world.
3. To automatically start the app when you sign in, press <kbd>Win</kbd><kbd>R</kbd>, type `shell:startup`, and move the downloaded program into the folder that appears.
4. To ensure that the icon is always visible and not hidden behind the “Show hidden icons” arrow, right-click on that arrow, select “Taskbar settings”, click “Select which icons appear on the taskbar”, and enable the toggle for Wurstmineberg.

# Usage

* The icon only appears as long as someone is online on the main world. You can hover over it to see how many people are online (and if it's only one player, their name).
* You can left-click on the icon to start Minecraft.
* You can right-click on the icon to see the current version (with a link to the [Minecraft wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/) article about that version), as well as the full list of everyone who's online (with links to their Wurstmineberg profiles).
